R is a programming language and environment designed for statistical computing, data analysis, and graphical representation. R is widely used by statisticians, data scientists, researchers, and analysts for various tasks related to data manipulation, statistical modeling, and visualization. R is particularly well-suited for tasks involving data analysis, visualization, and statistics, chosen for its flexibility and a wide array of available tools.

This course takes us on a transformative journey through R programming, from foundational concepts to cutting-edge techniques. We will delve into Râ€™s fundamentals, data types, variables, and structures. We will explore R programming with custom functions, control structures, and data manipulation. We will analyze data visualization with leading packages, statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and regression modeling. With regular expressions, we will understand advanced data manipulation, outlier handling, missing data strategies, and text manipulation. We will learn about ML with regression, classification, and clustering algorithms. We will explore DL, neural networks, image classification, and semantic segmentation.

Upon completion, we will be able to create dynamic web apps with Shiny and emerge as skilled R practitioners, ready to tackle challenges and contribute to data-driven decision-making.
